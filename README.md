# TDD / BDD Final Project

This repository contains the my proposition for the final exam of TDD/BDD or the Coursera course Introduction to TDD/BDD.

## Changes

* done the job on my own computer with VSCODE so maybe some small config change.
* web server on port 8081. 
* The configuration for the SELENIUM use (environment.py) is slightly rewrited.

## Working/Non Working

* TDD : All seems to work. Just sometimes crash of the lint task on some files.
* BDD : A bug on some tests (2 errors failing 4 steps/~100). Always related to "HAT" element. Even by hand. The "search" button is often finding an empty element. After "Clean" the "Search" again, it works... Tried to understand, do some log (that are let in code) bur out of time and ideas...
